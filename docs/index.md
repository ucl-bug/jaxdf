# `jaxdf`

`jaxdf` is a customizable framework for writing differentiable simulators, that decouples the mathematical definition of the problem from the underlying discretization.

The underlying computations are performed using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), and are thus compatible with the broad set of program transformations, such as automatic differentiation and automatic batching. This enables rapid prototyping of multiple customized representations for a given problem, to develop physics-based neural network layers and to write custom physics losses, while maintaining the speed and flexibility required for research applications.

It also contains a growing open-source library of differentiable discretizations compatible with the JAX ecosystem.
